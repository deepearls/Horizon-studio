            What do you know about relaxationand Rehabilitation?
            Relaxation techniques are therapeutic exercises designed to assist individuals
            by decreasing tension and anxiety. In addition to its psychological impact,
            stress can cause physiological responses such as increased heart rate,
            palpitations, excess sweating, shortness of breath, and muscle tension.
            Many variations of relaxation strategies exist and can be facilitated by
            a variety of health professionals or learned via self-help modalities.

            Rehabilitation hospitals are considered post-acute care providers,
            meaning they typically treat patients who require additional care after first being treated in a traditional
            hospital.
            However, in some cases our patients are admitted from another setting or even directly
            from their homes. <br>
